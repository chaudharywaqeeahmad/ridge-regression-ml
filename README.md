# Ridge Regression using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Ridge Regression**
(L2-regularized linear regression) using Python and Scikit-learn.
The model is trained on synthetic data and evaluated using
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Problem Statement
Linear regression models often overfit when features are highly
correlated. Ridge Regression solves this problem by adding
L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients.

## Methodology
- Generated synthetic dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained Ridge Regression model
- Evaluated model using RMSE

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Results
The trained model achieved a reasonable RMSE on the test data,
demonstrating effective regularization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells
